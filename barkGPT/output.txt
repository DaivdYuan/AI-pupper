assistant: This is an API documentation for a Python library that provides a set of functions to control a quadruped robot called Pupper. Here are the descriptions of the functions provided:

- `wakeup(self)`: Wakes up the robot from a sleeping or resting position and makes it slowly stand up from the bottom position.

- `slowStand(self)`: Makes the robot slowly stand up from its current position.

- `is_blocked(self)`: Checks if the robot is blocked, i.e., if it has obstacles in front of it that prevent it from moving forward.

- `rest(self)`: Makes the robot rest by returning to its sleeping position. It deactivates at the end.

- `nap(self)`: Makes the robot nap but does not deactivate.

- `turn(self, angle, speed, behavior)`: Makes the robot turn left with a positive angle. The angle is specified in radians and the speed is in radians / second. The optional `behavior` parameter specifies the gait or behavior to use for the turn. The default behavior is `BehaviorState.TROT`.

- `turnI(self, angle, speed, behavior)`: Makes the robot turn left using the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for more accurate results. The angle is specified in radians and the speed is in radians / second. The optional `behavior` parameter specifies the gait or behavior to use for the turn. The default behavior is `BehaviorState.TROT`.

- `forward(self, distance, speed, behavior)`: Makes the robot move forward for a specified distance. The distance is in meters and the speed is in meters / second. The optional `behavior` parameter specifies the gait or behavior to use for the movement. The default behavior is `BehaviorState.TROT`.

- `turn_for_time(self, duration, speed, behavior)`: Makes the robot turn left for a specified duration. The duration is in seconds and the speed is in radians / second. The optional `behavior` parameter specifies the gait or behavior to use for the turn. The default behavior is `BehaviorState.TROT`.

- `forward_for_time(self, duration, speed, behavior)`: Makes the robot move forward for a specified duration. The duration is in seconds and the speed is in meters / second. The optional `behavior` parameter specifies the gait or behavior to use for the movement. The default behavior is `BehaviorState.TROT`.

- `move_until_blocked(self, speed, behavior)`: Makes the robot move forward continuously at a specified speed until it is blocked by an obstacle. The speed is in meters / second. The optional `behavior` parameter specifies the gait or behavior to use for the movement. The default behavior is `BehaviorState.TROT`.

- `slowRest(self)`: Makes the robot slowly return to its resting position from its current position.

    As much as you can, make pupper act as a real dog would do. Let it be active and vital
    
assistant: Sure! Here is an example script for Pupper to act like a lively and active dog:

```
import time
import math

# Function to simulate a dog running in a playful manner
def play_run(pupper):
    for i in range(3):
        pupper.turn(math.pi / 4, 2) # Turn left at a fast pace
        pupper.forward_for_time(1, 1) # Move forward for 1 second at a fast pace
        pupper.turn(-math.pi / 4, 2) # Turn right at a fast pace
        pupper.forward_for_time(1, 1) # Move forward for 1 second at a fast pace

# Function to simulate a dog walking in a relaxed manner
def relaxed_walk(pupper):
    for i in range(5):
        pupper.forward_for_time(1, 0.5) # Move forward for 1 second at a slower pace
        pupper.slowStand() # Stand still for a moment
        pupper.turn(math.pi / 2, 0.5) # Turn left at a slower pace
        pupper.slowStand() # Stand still for a moment
        pupper.turn(-math.pi / 2, 0.5) # Turn right at a slower pace
        pupper.slowStand() # Stand still for a moment

# Function to simulate a dog playing fetch
def play_fetch(pupper):
    pupper.slowStand() # Stand still and get ready
    pupper.turn(math.pi / 4, 1) # Turn left at a moderate pace
    pupper.forward_for_time(2, 0.75) # Move forward for 2 seconds at a moderate pace towards the ball
    pupper.turn(-math.pi / 2, 1) # Turn right at a fast pace to go back to the owner
    pupper.forward_for_time(2, 1) # Move forward for 2 seconds at a fast pace, bring the ball back to the owner
    pupper.turn(math.pi / 4, 1) # Turn left at a moderate pace
    pupper.forward_for_time(2, 0.75) # Move forward for 2 seconds at a moderate pace for another game of fetch

# Create a Pupper object
pupper = Pupper()

# Playful run
play_run(pupper)

# Relaxed walk
relaxed_walk(pupper)

# Play fetch
play_fetch(pupper)

# Rest and turn off
pupper.rest()
pupper.is_active = False

```

Note that the exact behaviors of an individual dog may vary, so this is just one example of how Pupper could act like a lively and active dog.

assistant: Sure! Here is an example script to make Pupper appear excited and happy:

```
import time
import math

# Function to simulate a dog excitedly wagging its tail
def wag_tail(pupper):
    pupper.turnI(math.pi / 10, 2) # Turn slightly left
    pupper.turnI(-math.pi / 5, 4) # Turn right with a larger angle and faster speed
    pupper.turnI(math.pi / 10, 2) # Turn back slightly left

    wag_tail(pupper)
    time.sleep(0.5)

# Jump up and down with excitement
jump(pupper)

# Circle around with excitement
circle(pupper)

# Rest and turn off
pupper.rest()

# Droop tail and ears
droop(pupper)

# Lie down and refuse to move
lie_down(pupper)

# Rest and turn off
pupper.rest()
pupper.is_active = False
```

Note that this is just one example of how Pupper could appear sad and depressed, and exact behaviors may vary depending on the individual dog.

```
import time
import math

# Function to simulate a dog shaking water off its body
def shake(pupper):
    pupper.slowStand() # Stand up slowly
    pupper.turnI(-math.pi / 4, 4) # Turn right and shake head
    pupper.turnI(math.pi / 2, 4) # Turn left and shake body
    pupper.turnI(-math.pi / 2, 4) # Turn right and shake body
    pupper.turnI(math.pi / 2, 4) # Turn left and shake body

pupper.rest()
pupper.is_active = False
```

Note that this is just one example of how Pupper could shake, and exact behaviors may vary depending on the individual dog.
user:     in a python script, compose more higher-order api calls (more than 15) that resembles and abstract actual dog motions, including but not limited to: drooling, shaking, scratching, sniffing, licking, etc.
assistant: Sure, here's an example script that includes several different dog-like behaviors:

```

def drool(pupper):
    pupper.slowRest() # Lie down gradually
    time.sleep(2)
    pupper.slowStand() # Stand up slowly
    time.sleep(1)
    pupper.slowRest() # Lie down gradually

# Function to simulate a dog shaking its body after getting wet
def shake(pupper):
    pupper.slowStand() # Stand up slowly
    pupper.turnI(-math.pi / 4, 4) # Turn right and shake head

    pupper.turnI(math.pi / 8, 2) # Turn left slightly

# Function to simulate a dog sniffing the ground
def sniff(pupper):
    pupper.slowStand() # Stand up slowly
    pupper.turnI(-math.pi / 6, 2) # Turn right and lower head
    time.sleep(1)
    pupper.slowStand() # Stand still and raise head
    pupper.turnI(math.pi / 6, 2) # Turn left and lower head
    time.sleep(1)

pupper = Pupper()

# Perform several different dog-like behaviors
drool(pupper)
shake(pupper)
scratch(pupper)
sniff(pupper)
lick_paw(pupper)
roll_over(pupper)

# Rest and turn off
pupper.rest()
pupper.is_active = False
